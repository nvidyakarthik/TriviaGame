# How it works

* Trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulates them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, without the user input next question  is displayed.
* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
* If the player runs out of time, player gets notified that time's up and correct answer is displayed for a few seconds and  then the screen moves on to the next question.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, player gets notified that they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed.After a few seconds, the screen shows up the next question.
* On the final screen, number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game is displayed.
